# Algorithms Code #

## About ##
This repository includes code used to solve the given algorithmic problem statements for coursework. All code solves all given test cases with efficient time.

## Structure ##
Each of the folder includes the following
* student_code_x.h – this file should contains the solution
* problem_solver_x.cpp – this is the main file in the project to run the tests
* test_framework.h – this is a library responsible for reading and writing data files
* small_problem_set_x.in and large_problem_set_x.in – these files contain test problems for
your algorithm
* problem_solver_x.exe - this file is the executable that runs the given test set, e.g. `problem_solver_1.exe small`
